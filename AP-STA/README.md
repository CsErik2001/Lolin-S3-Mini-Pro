# AP-STA Communication

This project demonstrates how to set up two ESP32 devices for peer-to-peer communication. One ESP32 acts as an Access Point (AP), and the other acts as a Station (STA). The AP device can send data based on button presses and display received data on a TFT screen. The STA device connects to the AP, sends data based on button presses, and displays received data on its own TFT screen.
